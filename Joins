/*

SQL joins are used to combine data from two or more tables based on a common field between them (Usually the Primary key / Foreign Key) 
The relationship between the primary key and the foreign key allows us to extract data from both tables.

There are several types of joins; the common ones are:

Inner join
Left outer join
Right outer join
Full outer join 
A combination of inner and outer join


An introduction to the creation of tables will clarify how joins work when we use SQL joins.
When we create a table with various columns, we also create a column with increasing values such as an integer.  
This column is then set as a primary key for that whole table; and the purpose of that primary key is to keep each row of data unique.  
We then create that primary key column in another referencing table and this then becomes the foreign in the new table.  
This relationship between the primary key and the foreign key allows us to extract data from both tables.
